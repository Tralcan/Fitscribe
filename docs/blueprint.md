## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong cyan (#49B8E5) to evoke sky, water, movement.  This hue communicates activity without being overly aggressive. 
- Background color: Light cyan (#E5F5FB), visibly of the same hue, heavily desaturated. 
- Accent color: Blue-violet (#845EC2) to add depth, and provide contrast for primary actions such as 'Download'. 
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean and modern user interface.
- Use icons that clearly represent each sport category to match user intention. Ensure the icons match the active tone of the application.
- Prioritize providing simple options without hiding content. Consider utilizing column sections to provide better UX.
- Subtle transition animations for file uploads and sport type updates. Keep it simple and focused to prevent user fatigue.
